-- Note [Let expressions]
-- Let expressions are typechecked flexibly in order to minimise the instances
-- where an annotation must be added. Hence we can both synthesise and check
-- let expressions.
--
-- We can currently use lets to mimic top-level definitions, but when top-level
-- definitions become a first-class concept will we want to enforce that they
-- have an explicit type declaration.

-- | Synthesise a type for an expression.
-- We optionally insert/remove holes and insert annotations where
-- needed/possible, based on the SmartHoles option in the TypeM reader monad.
-- When we 'NoSmartHoles', the output will be the same as the input, modulo
-- caching type information in the metadata.
-- When we insert and remove holes and annotations, the AST may change.
-- The only changes we make to the AST are
-- - wrapping/unwrapping holes and annotations to make the types line up.
-- - recreating case branches if necessary (deleting their RHSs)
-- We return the synthesised type so one does not need to rely on
-- the cached type in the output being TCSynthed.
-- INVARIANT: if @synth e@ gives @(T,e')@, then @e@ and @e'@ agree up to their
-- cached types, and @TCSynthed T == typeOf e'@

  -- synthesises a type successfully (see Note [Holes and bidirectionality]).
  -- TODO: we would like to remove this hole (leaving e) if possible, but I
  -- don't see how to do this nicely as we don't know what constraints the
  -- synthesised type needs. Consider {? 1 ?} True: we can't remove the hole,
  -- but we don't know that when we come to synthesise its type. Potentially we
  -- could remove it here and let the App rule re-add it if necessary, but then
  -- consider {? ? : Nat -> Nat ?} True: then we could remove the hole, and App
  -- would see the function has an arrow type and check Nat âˆ‹ True which fails,
  -- leaving (? : Nat -> Nat) {? True ?}. This causes holes to jump around
  -- which is bad UX.
