-- | An identifier for an expression. Every node of the AST has an ID.

-- Note that we may remove the 'Ord', 'Enum', and/or 'Bounded'
-- instances in future implementations, so you should try not to rely
-- on them. (Internally, we rely on 'Ord' and 'Bounded', but that may
-- change in the future and is more or less not visible to external
-- consumers of this type.)

-- | A class for types which have an ID.
-- This makes it easier to change the underlying metadata representation without
-- breaking code that needs to work with IDs, because they use this class
-- instead of hardcoding paths to IDs or using chained 'HasType' instances,
-- which can lead to ambiguity errors.
